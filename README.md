Credit Risk Analysis Report

Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers by developing a machine learning model that predicts the risk of loan default. Using historical data from a peer-to-peer lending service, we employed a logistic regression model to classify loans as either healthy (low risk of default) or high-risk (high risk of default). This model aims to assist the lending company in making informed decisions regarding loan approvals.


Model Performance Metrics:

    •    Accuracy: 92%
    •    The model correctly predicts the loan status (healthy or high-risk) 92% of the time.
    •    Precision:
    •    Healthy loans (0): 93%
    •    When the model predicts a loan as healthy, it is correct 93% of the time.
    •    High-risk loans (1): 85%
    •    When the model predicts a loan as high-risk, it is correct 85% of the time.
    •    Recall:
    •    Healthy loans (0): 95%
    •    The model successfully identifies 95% of all actual healthy loans.
    •    High-risk loans (1): 80%
    •    The model successfully identifies 80% of all actual high-risk loans.

Summary

The logistic regression model demonstrates a strong overall performance in predicting credit risk, with a high accuracy of 92%. It excels in identifying healthy loans, as evidenced by a 93% precision and 95% recall for this category. However, the model’s performance is slightly lower for high-risk loans, with a precision of 85% and a recall of 80%. This indicates that while the model is reliable, it may miss some high-risk loans, which could result in unexpected defaults.

Recommendation:
Based on these results, the logistic regression model is recommended for use in the company’s loan approval process, especially given its strong accuracy and ability to identify healthy loans. However, it is advised that the company monitors the performance of the model, particularly in its ability to detect high-risk loans. If the cost of missing high-risk loans is substantial, further tuning of the model or the use of additional data and more sophisticated models may be necessary to improve the recall for high-risk loans.
